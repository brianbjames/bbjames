    <h3><span class="style1">Bio</span></h3>
    <p>Brian was born and raised in the dry-heated and smog-clouded Southern California. As a youth he spent his time playing baseball, playing soccer, and skateboarding the concrete. He past his time with things like learning electric and acoustic guitar, and collecting baseball cards. </p>
    <p>After a few years of breaking strings and not knowing how to properly tune, he decided it was best to join a punk rock band. The chap spent many hours and weeks and months playing in the pop-punk band Humor, and Crusty-Peace punk band The Scabs. </p>
    <p>Frustrated with a lack of music theory knowledge and formal skill, Brian set out to learn the music of the classical masters. He began study at Riverside Community College, learning theory, reading, and keyboard. He then transfered for a term over to UC Riverside, when he began improvising with his new found theoretical knowledge and  nylon guitar chops. It was duing this time he helped form the short lived prog-post-rock shoe gaze group The Christy Brown Project, and worked at a small record shop, and began teaching classical guitar and music theory. </p>
    <p>After all that, Brian up and moved to San Francisco and began taking classes at San Francisco State Univeristy where he began working in electonics and noise, as well as furthered his guitar skills. After learning Max/MSP, Reason, and Pro Tools, he formed the San Francisco free-improvisation unit Sound Test while making ends meet teacing guitar and theory. Brian at this time created Soundpress Records to publish recordings of  noise and experimental projects. </p>
    <p>After SFSU BA gradution, Brian begain study for his MFA at Mills College in Oakland, as well as took a full-time position working for Apple iTunes in the Content Control Department. For three years Brian cleansed the meta data of albums for iTunes while he stayed up into the wee-hours of the night soaking up the ins and outs of as many audio software environments, tools, and lanuagues as possible. During this time he began the Lairdander project and continued to produce on Soundpress Records. </p>
    <p>A short while after his Mills graduation, Brian fathered a lovely daugher named Thea, and currently  builds the iTunes App Store and Mac App Store. Brian resides with his family in San Francisco, and still continues to create electronic music, noise, ambient music, while enjoying time with his family. He still collects baseball cards. </p>
